# Forschungsdaten Infrastruktur Historischer Quellen (HisQu)
**Welcome to the internal organization repository** of the Forschungsdaten Infrastruktur Historischer Quellen (HisQu). This repository is dedicated to coordination, documentation, and onboarding resources for team members working on historical data projects.

> **Note:** This repo is private/internal at the moment but can be opened to the public in the future. The documentation and structure are built with that flexibility in mind.


## About This Repo
- **Organizational Documentation**: Includes project guidelines, roles, and responsibilities.  
- **Onboarding Resources**: Articles and tutorials for both historians and technical contributors to quickly get started.  
- **References & Links**: Points to relevant repositories and external resources (ontologies, coding best practices, etc.).

## Repository Overview

- **[Organisation (this repo)](https://github.com/HisQu/Organisation)**  
  The central repository that hosts our Wiki for onboarding and overall project documentation.

- **[RG_data](https://github.com/HisQu/RG_data)**  
  Contains raw Repertorium Germanicum data and various converted formats.

- **Coming Soon**:  
  - `ner_assistant` (Named Entity Recognition pipeline)  
  - `ontdev_assistant` (Ontology development pipeline)  

These will be migrated from GitLab into this organization in the near future.


## Getting Started
1. **Check the Wiki** (top tab): Our internal documentation covers how to set up your environment, follow best practices, and who to contact for any questions.  
2. **Clone or Fork** the necessary repositories: Start with `RG_data` if youâ€™re working with the Repertorium Germanicum dataset.  
3. **Open Issues**: If you encounter problems or have suggestions, please open issues in the relevant repository.


## How to Contribute
- **Pull Requests**: Make sure to follow our guidelines on Git commit messages, branching, and pull request reviews (more details in the Wiki).  
- **Code Style**: We adhere to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python code. Document your code clearly with docstrings and comments.
- **Community Feedback**: Tag relevant contributors or leads in discussions and issues.


## Future Plans
- **Expanded Ontologies**: Further refine and document the domain-specific ontologies for historical data.  
- **Collaborative Workflows**: Improve guidelines and best practices to ensure smooth collaboration between historians and developers.
