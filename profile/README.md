# Forschungsdaten Infrastruktur Historischer Quellen (HisQu)
Welcome to the **Forschungsdaten Infrastruktur Historischer Quellen** (HisQu) organization on GitHub!  
HisQu is an initiative to build an open research data infrastructure for historical sources, focusing on structured data extraction, ontology development, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) for historical texts.

> **Note:** We're still in the process of setting things up! If you have any questions or can't find something, feel free to reach out by opening an [issues](https://github.com/HisQu/Organisation/issues) in this repository. We'd be happy to help! ðŸ˜‰.
